# AndroidContactsRestore

Created because Samsung messed up and lost all my contacts in their cloud. Luckily I still had a TWRP backup of the data
partition (which unfortunately was bootlooping). This script extracts the contacts from
the `com.samsung.android.providers.contacts` database and exports it to a vcf file.
